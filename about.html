    haley’s research and practice is made up of exploratory writing, music composition, sound making, and listening. haley is particularly interested in how these practices relate to place/land, and identity.

    in early 2026 haley defended her master’s thesis titled <i>Art/Place Making in a Settler Colonial Context : A Critical Place Inquiry on the Haldimand Tract / Kitchener-Waterloo From a White Settler Perspective</i>

    this investigation surfaced place-based meaning regarding how white settler artists might use their creative practices to support practices of accountability and solidarity with Indigenous resurgence and sovereignty.

    part of haley’s work includes contributing to the formation of collective spaces and community forums. as part of the fox collective she organizes music shows in her living room. as part of the Laurier Wellbeing in Film Forum haley organizes free film nights at the cinema which are followed by audience-led discussion forums. 
    
    often pulled to talk to strangers, take a wrong turn, forget her phone, and sing while biking. by doing so haley seeks magic in everyday life.
